# Deep Learning Gender Recognition

This project is a **team-based deep learning project** for classifying gender (male/female) from voice data.  
The **main work** is provided in a Jupyter/Colab notebook.  
My main contribution was focused on **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and dataset preparation** to ensure high-quality inputs for training the deep learning model.

## Features
- **Data preprocessing**: cleaning, encoding labels, handling features.
- **Feature engineering**: extracting relevant audio features (spectral, statistical, etc.).
- **Dataset preparation**: splitting into training/testing sets, scaling, and reshaping data for RNN input.
- **Visualization**: correlation heatmaps and exploratory data analysis.
- RNN-based deep learning model for binary classification (male vs female).
- Model evaluation with accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrix.
